    <p> The Nike Air Max 90 is considered one of the all-time greatest sneakers, and was an incredibly innovative running sneaker upon its release in 1990.</p>

    <h2>Why Should you love Nike Air Max?</h2>
        <p> The Nike Air Max was revolutionary for its time. </p>
        <p> It is largely considered one of the most significant product developments in the history of Nike footwear</p>
        <p> The included, and eventually exposed, air unit was the brain child of famed designer Tinker Hatfield, who would later go on to create many more influential Nike shoes (Air Jordans anyone?)</p>
        
    <h3> What is Air Max Technology?</h3>
        <p> As the name would lead you to believe, the term air max is reserved for shoes containing a translucent plastic pouch in the midsole containing pressurized air.</p>
        <p> While this technologically originated unexposed within the Air Max Tailwind, it would evenntually be made visible in the shoe, creating the cultural sneaker icon we know it to be today!</p>
        <p> It has receieved numerous iterations since its inception and is employed in many different models from performance shoes, to its now most common use - lifestyle wear</p>
